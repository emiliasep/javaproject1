Emilia Seppanen - Study Calendar

This is a Study Calendar I created as a JavaScript project.
Study session is created by choosing time and subject and all sessions are saved on local file.
There is also option to clear the summary and to type in your name.

I think this project meets the requirements of this assingment. 
All functionalities work, although some small errors may still occure.
UI could use a little bit more detailing to make the app look better.
